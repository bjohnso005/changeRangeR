\title{Calculate AOO}
\usage{
AOOarea(r, locs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{Raster layer of a binary SDM. Must be either unprojected in the WGS84 datum, or projected in a UTM projection measured in meters.}

\item{locs}{(optional) data.frame of occurrence records: Longitude and latitude. If provided, AOO of cells containing occurrence points
is returned. If NULL, AOO of SDM is returned.}
}
\value{
a list of three objects. The first object is a character showing the AOO of cells with occurrence records.
The second is a raster object of the resampled AOO. The third object (optional) represents the AOO raster showing pixels in which the localities occur, resampled to 2kmx2km
 (only if locs argument is supplied).
}
\description{
Calculate area of occupancy measured in 2km resolution using a binary SDM
}
\examples{
# create raster
r1 <- raster::raster(nrows=108, ncols=108, xmn=-50, xmx=50)
raster::values(r1)<- runif(n = (108*108))
r1[r1 < 0.5] <- NA
r1[!is.na(r1)] <- 1
# calculate aooArea
AOOarea(r = r1)
}
